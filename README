Simple CoreMIDI for Python
====

Simple CoreMIDI for Python is the simplest way of using MIDI on Mac OS
X. Period.


Installation
----

    pip install simplecoremidi


Usage
----

    from simplecoremidi import send_midi
    send_midi((0x90, 0x3c, 0x40))

This sends a MIDI Note On signal. To receive it you'll have to
configure your DAW or software to receive from the "simple core midi
source" MIDI source.

That's it.


Notes
----

+ It only works on Macs. It will never work on Windows or Linux.

+ It only sends. Maybe it will receive someday.

+ It is not configurable.
